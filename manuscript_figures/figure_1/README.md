## Figure 1: Overview of the Study Design, Workflow, and Patient Characteristics

####  (a) Overview of the study design, patient cohort, sample processing, and analysis workflow. 

####  (b) Clinical characteristics of patients (n = 263) in this single-cell study. The Forest plot illustrates the effect of various clinical features on progression free survival. 

####  (c)  Dotplot depicting the cross-section of samples based on autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and frontline treatment, where dot size indicates the number of patients and dot color indicates the type of treatment regimen. 

####  (d) Barchart shows the total number of patients with each of the six genetic events used for risk classification. 

####  (e) Upset plot showing the intersection of patients categorized as standard-risk (SR) or high-risk (HR) and non-progressor (NP) or rapid progressor (RP). 

####  (f) Kaplan-Meier curves display survival analysis for patients categorized based on risk stratification (HR vs SR), transplant as a frontline treatment, treatment type, and ISS staging.

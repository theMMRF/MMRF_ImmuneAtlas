Contains code for generating figures related to Figure 2: Single-cell immune atlas of multiple myeloma patient samples. This primarily includes cluster UMAPs, Dot Plots, Feature Plots for annotation, and stacked bar charts for average patient compositions.

This directory also includes the code to generate Supplemental Figure 2 (Additional UMAPs and Dot Plots for Other Compartments) and Supplemental Figure 10 (Exhaustion and Senesence markers in the T cell compartment)

Code for figure rendering is located in "PAPER_FIG2.Rmd". This depends on additional helper functions, which are found in the "Helper_Functions" directory.
